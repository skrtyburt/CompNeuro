*McCulloch, Warren S., and Walter Pitts. "A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity." The bulletin of mathematical biophysics 5.4 (1943): 115-133.*

Regarded as a seminal paper in computational neuroscience as well as the basis of modern machine learning, the importance of the early formulations of McCulloch and Pitts are hard to overstate. By treating the biological existence of neurons as computational devices, these scientists applied logical theory to biological systems, most notably coming up with the idea that the communicative signaling of neurons was "all-or-nothing" and could, in theory, be quantified by algorithms that utilized AND, OR, and NOT gates. Excluding the mathematical portion of the model, the dendritic equivalent of this modeled neuron receives one or more input signals. Next, the collection of signals are processed according to weight (excitatory weight and/or inhibitory weight). After this, a binary output is determined, either 0 or 1 with zero representing no firing of the "action potential" and 1 representing firing of the "action potential". Though simplicstic in design, this model of a single neuron was profound in that it allowed for a quantitative basis of the neuron, demystifying the most integral component of the nervous system.
